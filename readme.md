# SEPTA DV (1-4) Multi‑UAV Intelligent System

A modular, collaborative aerial robotics platform composed of four specialized UAV types working together as a unified intelligent system. Each drone class performs a distinct operational role, enabling synchronized missions in mapping, environmental analysis, border monitoring, disaster‑response support, and signal‑source detection.

## 📡 System Overview

SEPTA is a **multi‑agent aerial ecosystem**. Instead of relying on a single drone, the system deploys a coordinated fleet where each UAV contributes unique capabilities. All units operate from a shared ground station and support:

- Autonomous swarm flight  
- Distributed decision‑making  
- Real‑time data fusion  
- Multi‑mission parallel execution

## 🧩 Architecture

### **1. Multi‑Drone Composition**

The system includes four UAV classes:

- **UAV‑A > Septa Dv1 — Survey Unit**  
  High‑precision mapping, topography generation, environmental scanning.

- **UAV‑B > Septa Dv2 — Monitoring Unit**  
  Border observation, long‑range patrol, persistent situational awareness.

- **UAV‑C > Septa Dv3 — Rescue & Response Unit**  
  Disaster‑zone assessment, search‑support, rapid deployment in emergencies.

- **UAV‑D > Septa Dv4 — Signal Intelligence Unit**  
  Detection and localization of unknown, interfering, or unauthorized signal sources.

Each class is produced in multiple units and deployed collectively at a shared station.
